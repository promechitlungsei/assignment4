So it seems like you have the Master/Details template to apply the different sizing to your code, but you need to put your
'app.js' file into a file called MasterView.js under the ui/commons folder. When you place it there type this line of code at the
very last line [module.exports = MasterView;].Other than that your code can run fine as a regular app.js file. I would recommend using
a different color for the background or the text because of contrasting issues, but despite that I can see your resume picture in the 2nd page
and your personal info/contacts on the first so nice job!
