So it seems like you have the Master/Details template to apply the different sizing to your code, but you need to put your
'app.js' file into a file called MasterView.js under the ui/commons folder. When you place it there type this line of code at the
very last line [module.exports = MasterView;].Other than that your code can run fine as a regular app.js file. I would recommend using
a different color for the background or the text because of contrasting issues, but despite that I can see your resume picture in the 2nd page
and your personal info/contacts on the first so nice job! I ran this on the Android emulator for a nexus 5 phone and a nexus 10 tablet and even without 
the resizing code the placement looks ok, except for the picture on the second page it seemed like it was crushed due to the
dimensions of the tablet.
